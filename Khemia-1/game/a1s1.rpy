"It's nice, a sort of half-meditation that my Mindfulness teacher once taught me several years ago."
"Thoughts that come unbidden to the mind are not uncommon during meditation, though this time, it's quite different."
"Usually the thoughts don't have a clear purpose and offer little insight unless one delves into implied, and likely non-existent meanings."
"\"{i}So what's your explanation? That I'm going crazy? It wouldn't be the first time.{/i}\""
"\"{i}No, just that you should be careful when trying to reach that far. The mind can often be one massive illusion to its owner, especially concerning non-tangible matters.{/i}\""
"Now they very much have a purpose: Speaking about me."
"Still, it helps to calm my mind, pull it inward from the outward chaos."
"It helps me forget the responsibilities that rest upon my shoulders."
"They mainly rest on my mentor's shoulders but, in turn, he rests upon mine."
"\"{i}His mind, it's not... sound? It's been altered.{/i}\""
"\"{i}That'a a common feature for those like you.{/i}\""
"I frown, feeling as if these voices are being rather rude now, but I try to avoid the distraction."
"Focus..."
"Instead, I admire the way I'm able to isolate my mind in a place such as this."
"For many months afterwards, setting foot within these walls, or even on the campus grounds would fill me with such dread, I simply could not function properly."
"Now, I imagine that incident, a sphere of suffering and shock, to be in a different place in time and space, floating in nothingness."
"\"Ahewawi, {i}I feel it.{/i}\""
"I feel my focus falter again, hearing what vaguely sounds Khemian, almost like the word for pain."
"The altered suffix indicates something less solid, more ethereal."
"\"{i}See? He hears me.{/i}\""
"\"{i}Do not alert him to our presence.{/i}\""
"\"{i}So now you believe me. Besides, he is already alert. He's just ignoring us. Like I said, he's gifted. But fine, you can relax, I'll stop.{/i}\""
"Focus."
"I instead ponder on why my mind might be thinking of pain... And then imagery, visceral and vivid flashes through my mind's eye."
"Those events are three years behind me now."
"Not only that, but the point in space in which the riots occurred is billions of kilometers behind me."
"That small sphere adrift in time and space."
"A dark void that I shall never return to."
"And it continues to move away as our galaxy spins through the ever-expanding universe."
"The halls of the university are only an illusion of a constant space."
"Rather, we are at a different point in the universe every moment we exist, whether that be at home, school, or on a diplomatic mission to Khemia."
"Therefore, I am free from that moment, and that place."
"Now I am in a clean space, and that's true for every moment I exist."
"That's exactly the kind of space I need to exist in mentally, especially if I want to keep this assignment."
"The type of assignment I've wanted my whole life."
"The exact one, if I'd known such an opportunity would exist."
"A sound mind is one of my most important assets."
"The past is in the past..."
"...And yet, the framing of the space {i}is{/i} constant; the marble, the statues, the lecture halls."
"These were all here when it happened, and they are here now, so is it really clean?"
"Stone does not live, therefore it cannot witness."
"It can not be corrupted like the minds of sapients."
"But is that even true?"
"I realize my meditation is veering off-course, but it's easy to be distracted when you're lying on a marble bench and your head is beginning to ache."

"I begin the process of {i}grounding{/i}, rubbing my paws over the cool, polished marble."
"Have these marble benches and pillars, the facade of this building, witnessed and absorbed the lives that spoke and moved around them before now?"
"If so, then simply distancing myself from a point in space is useless as the objects most important to that event continue to exist nearby."

"I'm disturbed by that voice, much different from the first two I had been hearing."
"More worryingly, the thought had been so loud and clear, I thought it had to have been spoken by someone, until I opened my eyes and found the room empty."
"In fact, I pinpoint it to the statue right in front of me, the one of the spy Antonia, crouching on her pedestal."
"A strange, dark feeling enters my mind as I frown, staring at it."
"I'd certainly heard something from that direction, like a whisper, and though I try to prevent it, my mind wanders to a more pup-like state."
"There is no question that this university is filled with un-amalgamated spirits, and even in the bright, morning light that pours through the windows, Antonia appears eerie to me."
"Her most famous deed was being an asymptomatic carrier of Lucius fever while a prisoner on Khemia, the outbreak killing hundreds of thousands, a death toll worse for the jackals than any of the battles waged during the war."

"I had been one of them, and just last week, I was officially chosen by both Amicus and Veteris."
"This despite the fact that I was solidly middling between the other two students in our academic marks."

"I wince, and I can't stop the blush from spreading across my own muzzle."
"We are very different in this regard as well."
"I'd been to Veteris's residence on a handful of occasions, and while his study was indeed clean, the rest of it was not."
"Maybe it's a representation of the one aspect of his life that he has in order, having abandoned his personal life before becoming an instructor."
"My \"study\", which often doubles as my sleeping quarters after being selected two years previously, is one usually reserved for assistant instructors."

m "\"Well, the only other reason that comes to mind might be my relationship to Neferu.\""
ve "\"And Brunis. You cultivated casual Khemian friendships with them with very little effort.\""
"Of course."
"I did know that forming some type of relationship with the actual Khemians we have here was important."
"Over the past year, I've made time to speak to them after each of our meetings, making sure to casually greet them and engage in causerie, which I knew Veteris and Amicus took notice of."
"While Carbo usually had his nose in a book, I was talking to real Khemians in a casual and friendly way."
"I wouldn't say that I know them as well as the few wolves I've considered my friends over the years, but I needed some type of advantage over Carbo."
"I had felt bad at the time, remembering his expression of confusion and disbelief as he left the imperial palace after being dismissed from his current duties."
"But really, I know his future as a prestigious scholar is almost guaranteed, and at the very least, the stresses of this mission are now over for him."
"Now, it seems like I need to focus even more on interacting with these Khemians, and it only makes sense considering the main mission is to expand Adastra'a relations with Khemia."
ve "\"Where did you learn to do that, by the way?\""
"Veteris eyes me curiously as I arrange the plate amongst the scatterings of books and Khemian tech."
m "\"I mean, it's not difficult, you simply--\""
ve "\"It is very difficult for a wolf! Casual friendships only create opportunity for casual betrayals. However--\""

ve "\"It provides opportunity for the casual gathering of intelligence as well.\""
"I feel my stomach turn again, despite knowing this would be part of my assignment as a diplomat, it doesn't mean I'm eager to do it."
"Still, the topic hadn't ever really come up, and with the departure date apparently nearing faster than expected, I had hoped that I would somehow be exempt."
m "\"You want me to spy?\""
"I say it evenly, in a way I hope doesn't betray the hesitance and lack of confidence I feel."
ve "\"Amicus would simply like for you to keep an eye on them. As we know by now, Khemian bluntness is a myth. We can never be sure of their true intentions.\""
"While the feelings of friendliness I have toward the Khemians are genuine, I remind myself that I did become their friend with the main purpose of personal gain, along with the knowledge that I would be reporting anything of importance they said."
m "\"I must admit that academia is my strong point, Veteris. I'm not sure--\""
ve "\"You accepted the position of a diplomat, thus you accepted the responsibility to gather intelligence for your emperor. It is part of your many responsibilities now.\""
m "\"Of course, teacher, but where do I even start? I'm not trained in espionage. Shouldn't there be more time for me to train for such a thing?\""
ve "\"Don't ask me, I'm simply a part-time teacher and full-time advisor to the emperor on Khemian politics and culture. He only wanted me to prepare you mentally.\""
m "\"It feels like a completely different discipline.\""
"Veteris waves his paw again."
ve "\"The reason you are not formally trained in spying is because this type of 'spying' is merely information-gathering, through individual relationships and larger networks.\""

"So far, Neferu hasn't shown any indication that he intends to tell anyone else about how he saw me react."
"Still, that frosty look on his face when he left just now..."
"Though I had been reluctant to share my experience with the jackal, I now think it would be wise to open up to him a bit."
"He'd seen my reaction and questioned it, and seemed offended by my unwillingness to share."
"I decide to try to achieve some understanding, just in case he goes elsewhere for answers."
"During the psychological portion of the vetting process for my position, I'd almost crumbled multiple times."
"I doubt I'd be able to do it again in my current state."
"{i}Then maybe they chose the wrong wolf?{/i}"
"It will be difficult, confessing my mental weaknesses to someone that isn't my mindfulness teacher, or my mother--"

m "\"Do you have a portal here that I can use?\""
com "\"I'm sorry, but I cannot allow you to use technology reserved for the imperial family--\""
"I sigh, wondering if I'll have to ask Neferu to borrow his."
com "\"However, your personal portal is due to arrive within the minute, along with the rest of your belongings. Would you like me to send it to you in the baths?\""
m "\"Er... Yes, please.\""
"I quickly stand to soap up, scrubbing, and then rinsing my fur, careful to really get the spots that felt hard and bristled."
"I dry my fur in a hurry, and as I'm dressing, a tiny drone floats down from an opening in the ceiling, balancing a silver rod, about the length of my forearm, on its top."
"I pluck my portal from the floating machine in a delicate manner, now very aware of what they're capable of in combat."
m "\"Thank you...\""
"I mumble quietly, but it immediately floats away, back to its ceiling hatch."

"I quickly tap it to extend the transparent, glowing panel from the rod."
"I feel my heart leap in my chest when I see that I have a message waiting for me from Mother."
"I'd hoped that maybe she hadn't been up yet, even though Lux is several hours ahead of Adastra, and she's always up before Vita rises."
"I open it and read the small message:"
"{i}Skippy, I hope you are well. Did you fall asleep early? I imagine they must be working you quite hard. Please respond when you can. All my love!{/i}"
"{i}-Mother.{/i}"
"It was sent around the time I'd been asleep, before it happened."
"What if I hadn't survived and never sent her a final message because of my forgetfulness?"
"I start to type a message back, a quick one, but then I notice the icon in the corner."
"Visual communication is what truly makes this device a \"portal\"."
"We only use it once weekly, but that day is two days away, and because I missed sending my message on time, and because I miss Mother..."
"I push the icon resembling an arrowhead, as if pointing in the direction of where she is, thousands of kilometers away."
"She answers within seconds, and at first, all I see is white fabric, then a bracelet, then my mother's face."
"Mother" "\"Skip! Are you alright? You fell asleep, didn't you?\""
"She doesn't sound too worried or upset, but her chiding voice makes it difficult to speak, for some reason."
"If I were to be completely honest, I'd give up my mission just to be with her again, to be in the warmth of our villa, with the smell of {i}olibun{/i} thick in the air."
"Mother" "\"Scipio? You're alright, aren't you? Have you just had a bath? Your mane is sticking up all over. I wish these were actual portals. I'd reach through and fix it right now.\""
